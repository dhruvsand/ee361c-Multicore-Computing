The fine grain lock implementation of the binary search tree has three parameters to test the code. The first parameter is the number of threads created to access the tree, (this number must be positive and non-zero). The second parameter determines the number of insert operations that each thread will execute, (negative numbers will halt thread execution without any operations). The third parameter determines the specific test case, (0-2) to use with the previously specified parameters. Zero specifies a test case where a number of random elements are inserted into the tree and deletes occur during the insert process. One specifies the test case in which duplicate numbers are repetitively inserted. Two specifies a test case where a large range of numbers are inserted into the tree. The main method is located in FineGrainBST.java.
